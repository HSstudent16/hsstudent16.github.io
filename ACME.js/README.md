## About ACME
ACME, the Axis-aligned Collision management Engine is a lightweight library designed to shorten the amount of code needed to write a 2D game, especially when using "bitmapped" levels.

## About this repo
This is my first time using version control period.  Please be patient while I learn the system.

## So, what is all this?
This repo holds my attempt at a documentation website for ACME, ACME.js itself, and all relevant files.
